# How the rain fell during Harvey 

When projections showed Hurricane Harey could bring a record setting amount of rain to Houston, the graphics desk at the New York Times started exploring ways of showing the water. What does record setting rainfall look like in different parts of the country? Where and when did it rain the hardest? And how can points on a map communicate people's experience of the rising water? 

This talk will describe the process of answering one of those questions, from parsing NASA's microwave data with R to creating a live-updating interactive map with d3 and canvas that showed both the [accumulation and rate of rainfall](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2017/08/24/us/hurricane-harvey-texas.html). 


Adam Pearce is a graphics editor at the New York Times. Previously he made interactive charts for Bloomberg Graphics. He's been learning how to use D3 for the last couple of years, posting his progress on roadtolarissa.com. Besides working with data visualizations, he's also been a cover model for Businessweek and a unicycled in a circus.
