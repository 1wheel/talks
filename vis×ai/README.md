## Why Aren't We Using Visualizations to Interact with AI?

Well-crafted visualizations are the highest bandwidth way of downloading information into our brains. As complex machine learning models become increasingly useful and important, can we move beyond mostly using text to understand and engage with them?

## Newsgraphics

### New ways of looking at information

sugar on data — more visually interesting than what's on most of the internet for someone bored at the office.

### Why did it stop working?

platforms hand out sugar hyper optimized for you now

mobile
- careful layout/annotations not possible
- new context — outside, other distracting things on your phone
- everything is a bar chart

### Exciting ml work

### Didn't change the cannon


https://pair.withgoogle.com/explorables/
- explain new research
- understandable by everyone
- meaningful interaction

same crosswinds
attention economy, platforms optimizing more around keeping people on them

parallel crosswinds
everything from 2018 or before!
https://github.com/tensorflow/tfjs/graphs/contributors

carcinization, but for tf playground instead crabs

Unique
bigger models, can't fit in the browser
https://pair.withgoogle.com/explorables/uncertainty-ood/
no privileged basis
https://distill.pub/2016/handwriting/

image models to text
https://distill.pub/2019/activation-atlas/
text isn't preattentive
text isn't continuous, deep dream feature visualization doesn't work

### Good explainer work

not interactive
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wjZofJX0v4M

not accessible
https://karpathy.ai/zero-to-hero.html


also charts are used to understand models!

https://github.com/karpathy/nn-zero-to-hero/blob/master/lectures/makemore/makemore_part3_bn.ipynb

and in reseach
https://arxiv.org/pdf/2001.08361
https://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.10962#page=6

but they're not interactive, why?
