# Tiny Tools

## Abstract

Reusing D3 code is hard. We're constantly trying to come up with novel designs and ways of encoding data, making it difficult to write code that is also composable and reusable. This talk will discuss the tiny tools we've used and developed at Bloomberg Graphics to sketch charts with code more quickly, reduce the amount of required copying/pasting, make it easier to move between illustrator and D3, simplify color selection, and more.


## Notes

This talk would be similar to [Alyson's last year](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c327ir3qvEo) (but with different techniques/tools) - basically the results of [Mike's FOSS4G talk](https://vimeo.com/106198518) peculating in our heads for a year and a half.
