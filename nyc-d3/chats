ADAM PEARCE
17:09:50 Hey, this article isn't showing up in the terminal correctly NSN NUFH056KLVR6 <Go>
17:10:34 it should just be rendering this page - http://www.bloomberg.com/features/2015-how-apple-built-3d-touch-iphone-6s/?terminal=1 - with the terminal webkit
17:12:28 *** NIRAJ JUTHANI (BLOOMBERG/ 731 LEX) acknowledged the chat request
17:13:10 *** EMILY ENGELMAN (BLOOMBERG/ NEWSROOM:) acknowledged the chat request
NIRAJ JUTHANI
17:13:21 I am getting "Not Found

The requested URL /live/feature/2015-how-apple-built-3d-touch-iphone-6S/ was not found on this server."
17:13:28 Isn't that the webserver issue?
EMILY ENGELMAN
17:13:34 You're still getting that error message?
ADAM PEARCE
17:13:50 never mind - they marked the feature as having a major update and the newer version in the terminal is working
NIRAJ JUTHANI
17:14:11 What was wrong with the previous version/?
ADAM PEARCE
17:14:54 the url pointed at a page that didn't exist, we couldn't figure out how to update it
NIRAJ JUTHANI
17:15:33 Why couldn;t you set a redirct for that url?
17:15:42 Major update is not a complete solution
17:15:53 People still can access the broken version
17:16:26 And by the way it was not sent as major version
17:16:48 It was sent as independent new story. That's very bad
17:17:06 ERH BN C307 <Go> you will see both the stories
EMILY ENGELMAN
17:17:17 So what can we do
NIRAJ JUTHANI
17:17:37 The bad stories had 200 hits from clients
EMILY ENGELMAN
17:17:42 And how can we see what actually happened?
NIRAJ JUTHANI
17:18:01 What do you mean. I told you what happened.
EMILY ENGELMAN
17:18:06 And the URL that was entered the first time was correct, so I'm unclear what caused the error?
NIRAJ JUTHANI
17:18:13 You need to fix your publishing procedure
17:18:57 I have manually deleted the bad version.
17:19:08 But this is really very bad experience for our clients.
BLACKI MIGLIOZZI
17:20:05 Emily I fairly certain that the url was entered incorrectly
ADAM PEARCE
17:20:22 do you have a way of seeing what url the bad version had? the terminal webkit is a huge black box for us; we can't set up a redirect without knowing where to redirect from?
BLACKI MIGLIOZZI
17:20:36 it could have been an extra space in the url or something
NIRAJ JUTHANI
17:21:18 BAD url:
http://www.bloomberg.com/features/2015-how-apple-built-3d-touch-iphone-6S/?terminal=true

Good Url:
http://www.bloomberg.com/features/2015-how-apple-built-3d-touch-iphone-6s/?terminal=true
17:21:41 Notice that "-6s" 'S' is caps in bad one
EMILY ENGELMAN
17:21:44 We can probably use the redirect tool for this. Mike is going to try
17:21:58 And I think we've figured out what happened
ADAM PEARCE
17:25:12 is there a way we can see what the bad url is in case this happens again?
NIRAJ JUTHANI
17:25:47 yes.  NSN NUFH056KLVR6 <Go>  .. Go to action and copy web url.

17:34:31 oh, didn't realize that was possible
17:34:43 thank you for your help Niraj!
